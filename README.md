## Introduction

This is a simple web application that mimics the functionality and user interface of Google Docs. It allows users to create, edit, and collaborate on documents in real time. T
he application is built using React, and the `useEffect` hook is used to manage side effects. 
The text editor and toolbar is implemented using Quill, a powerful rich text editor.

## Features

- Create new documents
- Edit the documents
- Text Editor with Quill
- Formatting options for text (bold, italic, underline, etc.)
- Lists (bullet points, numbered lists)
- Undo/redo functionality

## Installation

To run the Google Docs clone locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nilabh2121/Google_docsClone_Nilabh
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can create a new document by clicking on the "New Document" button. Existing documents will be listed on the left side of the screen, and you can click on them to open and edit.
